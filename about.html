      <p class="content">
        My name is James Alan Eberwine. I was born and raised in San Antonio. I went to a private Christian school throughout elementary and middle school before attending Theodore Roosevelt High School. I then went to Texas AnM in College Station for a year before transfering to the Univerity of Texas at Austin. There I got my degree in linguistics with a minor in English. I was a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity. During and after college I worked at the Texas Senate, first as a messenger and then with Senate support services and as an assistant Sergeant at Arms. Since then I have worked as a legal and administative assistant and in 2017 I got my Texas real estate license.
